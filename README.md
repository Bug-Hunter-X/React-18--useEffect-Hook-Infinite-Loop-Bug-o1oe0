This repository demonstrates a common bug in React's `useEffect` hook, specifically related to missing dependencies in the dependency array.  Improperly specifying the dependency array can lead to unexpected re-renders and, in severe cases, infinite loops. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. This is a crucial concept to understand for building robust and performant React applications.
